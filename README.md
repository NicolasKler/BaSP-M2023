# Readme BASP-M2023
BASP-M2023 will be the reposritory where Nicolás Kler will be uploading all the soultions of the weekly problems in the 2023 Radium Rocket Bootcamp.
## Week 1
The first week we were asked to make a [screenflow](https://www.figma.com/file/JOzMQRmG7afMoeyk5FQtPy/BaSP-m2023-Megarocket-rave?node-id=701-367&t=UC4KnK1OJbE01i3y-0) of an imaginary gym called "Rocket GYM", I was assigned, along with my partner Gonzalo Reybet, to prototype the sign-in and sign-up windows. This was not an isolated task, since we had to interact with our other colleague to make it work properly. We were able to do it with great success, according to our tutors.
## Week 2
The second problem, which is located in the "Week-2" folder, was to make an HTML rendition of the desktop version´s landing page from the previously prototyped [screenflow](https://www.figma.com/file/JOzMQRmG7afMoeyk5FQtPy/BaSP-m2023-Megarocket-rave?node-id=701-367&t=UC4KnK1OJbE01i3y-0) of the gym "Rocket GYM" and save the process in [Github](https://github.com/NicolasKler/BaSP-M2023) following the conventions and good practices given to us. For this task, I was also asked to only use HTML, so no CSS or JS were used.

The solution is found on this [page](https://nicolaskler.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-02/index.html).
## Week 3
The third-week task was to add CSS (without flexbox) to the HTML from the week prior with the corrections that were given to us. To do this, we have to create a new folder called week-03 wich have another one named css with both the actual css and a reset file, wich reset the html predefine styles.
The CSS needed to replicate the styles in the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/JOzMQRmG7afMoeyk5FQtPy/BaSP-m2023-Megarocket-rave?node-id=701-367&t=UC4KnK1OJbE01i3y-0) for week one.

The solution is found on this [page](https://nicolaskler.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-03/index.html).
## Week 3
For this fourth week, the task given was to, once again, add the styles from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/JOzMQRmG7afMoeyk5FQtPy/BaSP-m2023-Megarocket-rave?node-id=701-367&t=UC4KnK1OJbE01i3y-0)´s landing page to the html from week 2 (with the corrections given by my tutor), but this time the assignment was to also make it responsive with the use of flexbox and without the employment of grid.
The responsiveness must work for mobile, tablet (minimum 480 px), and desktop (minimum 1024 px) viewports.

The solution is found on this [page](https://nicolaskler.github.io/BaSP-M2023/Week-04/index.html).

>**_NOTE:_**For the aside in mobile to work, you have to change the display from none to flex.
