# Readme BASP-M2023
BASP-M2023 will be the reposritory where Nicolás Kler will be uploading all the soultions of the weekly problems in the 2023 Radium Rocket Bootcamp.
## Week 1
The first week we were asked to make a [screenflow](https://www.figma.com/file/JOzMQRmG7afMoeyk5FQtPy/BaSP-m2023-Megarocket-rave?node-id=701-367&t=UC4KnK1OJbE01i3y-0) of an imaginary gym called "Rocket GYM", I was assigned, along with my partner Gonzalo Reybet, to prototype the sign-in and sign-up windows. This was not an isolated task, since we had to interact with our other colleague to make it work properly. We were able to do it with great success, according to our tutors.
## Week 2
The second problem, which is located in the "Week-2" folder, was to make an HTML rendition of the desktop version´s landing page from the previously prototyped [screenflow](https://www.figma.com/file/JOzMQRmG7afMoeyk5FQtPy/BaSP-m2023-Megarocket-rave?node-id=701-367&t=UC4KnK1OJbE01i3y-0) of the gym "Rocket GYM" and save the process in [Github](https://github.com/NicolasKler/BaSP-M2023). For this task, I was also asked to only use HTML, so no CSS or JS were used.
