# Readme BASP-M2023
BASP-M2023 will be the reposritory where Nicolás Kler will be uploading all the soultions of the weekly problems in the 2023 Radium Rocket Bootcamp.
## Week 2
The first problem to solve, which is located in the "week 2" folder, was to make an HTML rendition of the desktop version´s landing page from the previously prototyped screenflow of the imaginary gym "Rocket GYM" and save the process in [Github](https://github.com/NicolasKler/BaSP-M2023). For this task, I was also asked to only use HTML, so no CSS or JS were used.
